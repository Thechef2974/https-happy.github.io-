        <p>Another year around the sun is always something to celebrate! Sending birthday greetings is a wonderful way to honor the birthday of a partner, family member, friend, colleague, or any other loved one. When you’re deciding which birthday wishes to include within your celebratory birthday card gift, consider who you’re writing to. If you’re sending a sweet birthday message to a friend, you may want to go with something funny that reflects your goofy relationship. Maybe you’re sending a birthday card to your grandmother; a sweet birthday quote might be better suited. From the flowery and inspirational to the short and sweet, we’ve compiled an exhaustive list of lovely birthday messages for everyone on your list. </p>
